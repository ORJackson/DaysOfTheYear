# DaysOfTheYear
A 2 player game to be played on the command line

The game DaysOfTheYear is played by two players who take turns naming a date of the year starting from January 1st. On any move, a player may increase the month or the day but not both. Neither the day nor the month can be decreased, i.e. if a player calls 31st January the next player can only play 31st of March, May, July, August, October, or December.  The player who names December 31st wins - this is the aim of the game. 

To summarise:

The game is for two players
The game starts with the day: 1st January, or a new start date can be set when running the game
Each player takes it in turn to either increase the day or the month of the date
The player who names December 31st wins
